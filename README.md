# BlenderUmap2 QoL Plugins!
Just a bunch of QoL stuff I made working with Minshu's [BlenderUmap2](https://github.com/MinshuG/BlenderUmap2)

This was written for **Blender 4.2**! May not work for older version. I dunno.

# Requirements
* Blender 4.2 (Probably)
* [BlenderUmap2](https://github.com/MinshuG/BlenderUmap2)

# Installation
1. Head to [Releases](https://github.com/jaxbline/Umap-Utilites/releases)
2. Download which plugin you want
3. Install it like any other Blender Plugin
4. Profit

## Material Fixer
Plugin that quickly removes the node groups made by Umap and turns them into normal shader nodes made for exporting. It also will remove all duplicated materials created by checking the name before the .mat extension (it works... probably)

* Supports Diffuse, Metallic/Roughness, Emission, and Normals
  use the suffix of your unreal texture. In my case the suffix is _di
* Supports packed Alpha maps in the diffuse texture (check out the toggle for it)
  
*The plugin supports multiple inputs juuust incase*
